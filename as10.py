What is :
--- Negative indexing in python.
		-Negative index is used in python to index starting from the last element of the list, tuple or any other container class which supports indexing. 
		-1 refers to the last index, -2 refers to the second last index and so on.

--- Packing and UnPacking.
		-Packing-when we are not certain with how many arguments willbe paased to a function  we pack all
		the arguments as a tuple while receiving arguments using *. for receiving keyword arguments, we pack allt the arguments
		as a dictionary while receiving ar using **.
		-unpacking-it is used to pass list or dictionary at its element level.
		
--- Mutable and Immutable
		In object-oriented, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. 
		This is in contrast to a mutable object, which can be modified after it is created.

--- Append and Extend
		-Adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list. The length of the list increases by one.
		- Iterates over its argument and adding each element to the list and extending the list. 
		  The length of the list increases by number of elements in itâ€™s argument.

--- Pickling and Unpickling
		-Pickling is a mini-language that can be used to convert the relevant state from a python object into a string, where this string uniquely represents the object. 
		Then unpickling can be used to convert the string to a live object, by "reconstructing" the object from the saved state founding the string.
